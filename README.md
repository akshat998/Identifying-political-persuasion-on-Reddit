# Red-team-blue-team-Identifying-political-persuasion-on-Reddit
This project is involved with a social media corpus (i.e., a collection of posts from Reddit), Python programming, part-of-speech (PoS) tags, sentiment analysis, and machine learning with scikit-learn.

The resource came from University of Toronto, CSC401 Natrual Language Procssing, Assignment 1, 2018 Spring.

The task was to split posts into sentences, tag them with a PoS tagger that we will provide, gather some feature information from each post, learn models, and use these to classify political persuasion. Sentiment analysis is an important topic in computational linguistics in which we quantify subjective aspects of language. These aspects can range from biases in social media for marketing, to a spectrum of cognitive behaviours for disease diagnosis.
